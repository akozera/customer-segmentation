# Customer Segmentation for Arvato Bertelsmann 

This project aims to analyze customer data from [Arvato](https://www.bertelsmann.com/divisions/arvato/#st-1) and to:
1. Create a Customer Segmentation Report by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population.
2. Build a supervised learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the marketing campaign.


### Deployment

All the necessary libraries to run the code were already available in the Anaconda distribution of Python and are incorporated in the Jupyter notebook apart from xgboost which can be installed via ```pip install xgboost```.

This script was written using Python version 3.*.

### Files & Data

- The jupyter notebook Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb contains the details of the analysis.
- Input data is licensed by Arvato and hence I cannot provide it here. The data consists of:
* demographics data for the general population of Germany
* demographics data for customers of the company
* demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign
